# Portfolio Website Example

This is a single-page portfolio example to practice CSS and responsive web design. In particular I wanted to practice flex-box and grid-template-areas.

I used the opportunity to make regular commits and update the main branch regulary- although I didn't need to return to a previous commit this is a habit I am trying to build.
